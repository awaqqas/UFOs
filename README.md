# UFOs

**Purpose**
The purpose of this assignment was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users will be able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. Filter button that was initially present is removed, which hinders the ability to actually hit the "search" button after the filter criteria is entered. In the current filtering methodology, users can press "enter" on their keyboards for the results to refresh or the list updates itself the moment next search item is entered. 

**Results**

To perform the search, users simply enter their criteria that they want to search by i.e. state, shape, country and date. The results update as soon as the user moves to the next criteria. This prevents from redundancy and only shows results specific to the first set of search criteria met. For example, in the image below the moment, the user inputs "bonita" for the city, the results update to that city and as such the user does not have the need to input other search criteria in. <img width="1423" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 11 53 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90429568/148720040-7091c9a7-c740-411f-8db1-666d108b9fc6.png">
Similarly, users can search by dates and shapes. This provides more search results in comparison to the state.

It is important to note that the text boxes for the search criteria have placeholders and as such appear as complete. Users may get confused with these placeholders and as such it would be recommended to remove these placeholders in the future. 

**Summary**

As mentioned one of the biggest drawbacks is that the user's capability to hit the "search" button once they are done entering the search criteria could lead to confusion. However, this is a paradox as it also narrows the results down without having to complete the other search criteria. Another, potential drawback is the placeholders. This may confuse the users, as it may appear that the search criteria has been completed in its entirety and the results do not reflect this. As such, it would be recommended to remove these placeholders.

The other two recommendations to enhance the UFO analysis is to perhaps make the dataset dynamic via an API from a trusted academic resource. This will provide a larger and live dataset that gets updated as the years move on. Additionally, another page should be added to the UFO sightings page, where more information is provided to the users along with a feedback form, which will allow the users to request any additional information about the UFOs that is currently amiss.
